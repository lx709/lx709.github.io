I joined KAUST as Postdoc Associate since Dec 2022. Before that, I was a Postdoc Associate at MMVC Lab, NYU Tandon and NYU Abu Dhabi since 2019. I received my Bachelor’s degree in remote sensing science and technology from Wuhan University in 2014 and the Ph.D. degree in Cartography and GIS from the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2019.
